									<h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
								</header>
								<p>With the rapid progression of urbanization and the increasing emphasis on enhancing human well-being, there is a growing demand for intelligent systems that prioritize human-centric design and functionality. Meeting this demand involves addressing key challenges, such as developing advanced sensing technologies to monitor various aspects of human life, including health indicators, behavioral patterns, and people’s interactions with the built environment. Moreover, it requires developing advanced AI models for human-in-the-loop applications, such as predictive tools for personalized healthcare, adaptive systems for long-term monitoring, and optimization algorithms to enhance daily activities and decision-making processes. Additionally, integrating user requirements into system architectures—encompassing intuitive interfaces, wearable and ambient devices, and context-aware functionalities—remains a critical priority. These advancements are pivotal for a wide range of human-centered applications, including healthcare systems that enable early diagnostics and proactive interventions, smart living environments that streamline and optimize daily routines, personalized learning platforms tailored to individual preferences, and advanced technologies that enhance accessibility and mobility across diverse populations in our community.</p>

								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<p>
									Wearable AI is an example of Mersivity. Mersivity regards technology as a vessel that interfaces us to each other and to our surroundings (environment). Indeed, the word "cyborg" (cybernetic organism) originates from the ancient Greek word "kybernetikos", referring to the skill of a helmsman. In the 1960s and 1970s, I created WearTel™️, a wearable telephone which I also envisioned as a wearable camera, wearable computer, etc., combining calculations, computation, and communication. At the time, computers were keeping us imprisoned in offices, whereas I envisioned computation as technology that becomes part of us wherever we want to go. Today we still have computers that imprison us, as we're hunched over, looking at a screen, or immersed in a virtual reality that we can't immerse, i.e., you can't go for a walk or a hike or a swim with it. I believe that if we're going to be surrounded by immersive technology, it should also be exmersive, i.e., immersible/submersible, or at the very least it should connect us with our surroundings -- i.e., it should be "mersive". This requirement gives rise to six fundamental signal flow paths, as outlined in the figure/illustration.

								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<p>
									This talk introduces physics-aided approaches to improve learning in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Learning has become a useful tool for data-rich problems. However, its use in CPS has been limited because of its need for a large amount of well-labeled data for each application and deployment. This is especially challenging and often impossible due to the high number of variables that can affect data distribution in CPS (e.g., weather, time, persons, etc.). This talk introduces combinational techniques that improves physical models and hardware characteristics to enable learning in CPS with “small data”. Specifically we incorporate physical characteristics to guide learning, and transfer data from other domains using the physical understanding. This talk illustrates these approaches through our deployment experiences in real world settings in sports stadiums and farms.

      <h3 class="talk-title">Skin-Interfaced Wearable Biosensors</h3>
      
      <div class="talk-abstract">
        <p>The growing interest in personalized medicine is set to transform conventional healthcare, offering new avenues for predictive analytics and tailored treatment approaches. In this talk, I will present our advancements in developing wearable biosensors for non-invasive molecular analysis. These wearables autonomously access and sample body fluids, such as sweat, wound exudate, and exhaled breath condensate, continuously monitoring a wide array of analytes—including metabolites, nutrients, hormones, proteins, and drugs—during various daily activities.</p>
        
        <p>To enable large-scale, cost-effective manufacturing of these high-performance nanomaterial-based sensors, we leverage techniques such as laser engraving, inkjet printing, and 3D printing. Our wearable systems' clinical applications are evaluated through human trials in areas like human performance monitoring, stress response and mental health assessment, precision nutrition, chronic disease management, and drug personalization.</p>
        
        <p>Furthermore, I will explore our efforts in energy harvesting from both the human body and the environment, paving the way for battery-free, wireless biosensing devices. This integration of wearable technologies has the potential to revolutionize personalized healthcare, spanning diagnostics, real-time monitoring, and therapeutic innovations.</p>
