								<h3 class="talk-title">Embedded Intelligence for Health and Wellness</h3>
								
								<div class="talk-abstract">
									<p>The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence are transforming embedded sensing systems, bridging the physical and digital worlds in unprecedented ways. In the domains of health, wellness, and everyday living, embedded AI empowers environments and devices to proactively support both physical and mental well-being, reflecting the increasing demand for systems that are both adaptive and sensitive to human needs. This talk highlights projects from the Columbia Intelligent and Connected Systems Lab (ICSL) that exemplify this vision.</p>
									
									<p>In healthcare, we present a low-cost, vision-based AIoT system for fever screening, designed for high accuracy and affordability. In the wearable space, we introduce a glasses-based platform for biosignal acquisition and emotion recognition, as well as an AR-assisted intelligent stethoscope for intuitive self-health monitoring. For personalized fitness, we showcase a smartphone-based system that estimates key running metrics such as cadence and ground contact time in real time, requiring no additional wearable devices. In intelligent environments, we present a reconfigurable drone platform capable of on-demand task execution through natural language interfaces powered by large language and vision models. In the mental health domain, we introduce CaiTI, a smart home AI therapist that continuously monitors daily routines and delivers personalized psychotherapeutic support, including motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
									
									<p>These projects illustrate how embedded intelligence research at ICSL is shaping the future of health and wellness, redefining the relationship between humans, machines, and their environments.</p>

								<div class="talk-abstract">
									<p>The growing interest in personalized medicine is set to transform conventional healthcare, offering new avenues for predictive analytics and tailored treatment approaches. In this talk, I will present our advancements in developing wearable biosensors for non-invasive molecular analysis. These wearables autonomously access and sample body fluids, such as sweat, wound exudate, and exhaled breath condensate, continuously monitoring a wide array of analytes—including metabolites, nutrients, hormones, proteins, and drugs—during various daily activities.</p>
									
									<p>To enable large-scale, cost-effective manufacturing of these high-performance nanomaterial-based sensors, we leverage techniques such as laser engraving, inkjet printing, and 3D printing. Our wearable systems' clinical applications are evaluated through human trials in areas like human performance monitoring, stress response and mental health assessment, precision nutrition, chronic disease management, and drug personalization.</p>
									
									<p>Furthermore, I will explore our efforts in energy harvesting from both the human body and the environment, paving the way for battery-free, wireless biosensing devices. This integration of wearable technologies has the potential to revolutionize personalized healthcare, spanning diagnostics, real-time monitoring, and therapeutic innovations.</p>

						</header>
						<p>This workshop aims to foster collaboration among researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and service sectors, providing a platform to share ideas and experiences in developing human-centered systems.</p>
						
						<h2>Topics of Interest</h2>
						<p>We welcome contributions that emphasize human-centric sensing technologies, novel models for human-centered systems, and applications in areas including, but not limited to:</p>
						
						<h3>Human-Centered Sensing and Data Acquisition</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Novel sensing approaches for health, activity, gesture, behavior monitoring of individuals or groups (e.g., camera, VR/AR, wearables, mobile platforms, vibration, acoustics, IMU, mmWave/WiFi, etc.)</li>
							<li>Data management transmission methodologies (e.g., communication and networking)</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Human-Centered Static and AI Driven Models</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Statistical models for representing and analyzing human behavior, preferences, and environmental interactions include methods (e.g., regression analysis, Bayesian networks, clustering algorithms, matrix factorization techniques, etc.) that capture relationships within human-centered data.</li>
							<li>Advanced AI models and techniques involving data collected from humans (e.g., large language models, convolutional neural networks, transformers, graph neural networks, time series models, statistical learning models, etc.).</li>
							<li>System models or frameworks for human-in-the-loop applications.</li>
							<li>Data interpretation and metric prediction in human-centered cyber-physical systems.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Human-Centered System Design and Implementation</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Integration of human needs and preferences in the design of cyber-physical systems (e.g., privacy considerations, UI/UX design, integration of LLM agents, etc.)</li>
							<li>Prototyping and iterative system design to refine and validate human-centered solutions.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>Applications and Real-World Studies</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Real-world deployment experience with human participants</li>
							<li>Evaluation methodologies and insights of cyber-physical systems with human in the loop</li>

							<h1><b>Submission</b></h1>
						</header>
						<p>Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication.</p>
						
						<p>We will solicit papers in <u>three</u> categories:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><u>Full Papers</u> (up to 6 pages including references) should report reasonably mature work in human-centered sensing, networking, or multi-device systems. These papers are expected to demonstrate concrete and reproducible results, even if the scale may be limited.</li>
							<li><u>Experience Papers</u> (up to 4 pages including references) should present experiences with the implementation, deployment, and operation of novel sensing or networking technologies and systems for human-centered applications. Desirable papers are expected to include real data and descriptions of practical lessons learned.</li>
							<li><u>Short Papers</u> (up to 2 pages including references) are encouraged to report novel and creative ideas that have yet to produce concrete research results but are at a stage where community feedback would be useful.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<p>All papers will be at most <strong>6 single-spaced 8.5" x 11" pages</strong> with <strong>10-pt font size in two-column format, including figures, tables</strong>, and references. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="_blank">here</a>. LaTeX submissions should use the <code>acmart.cls</code> template (<code>sigconf</code> option), with the 10-pt font. All of the accepted papers (regardless of category) will be included in the ACM Digital Library. All papers will be digitally available through the workshop website, and the ACM Sensys 2024 Adjunct Proceedings. We will offer a "<u>Best Paper</u>" award, sponsored by Nokia Bell Labs, to one of the accepted papers.</p>
